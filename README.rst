DORMS - database of reproducible molecular simulations
*******************************************************

The database of reproducible simulations is an ongoing project whose aim is to provide well-documented simulation results for a variety of systems and from various simulation techniques.
The results contained here are generated in-house at NIST.
It is intended to provide guides for testing codes.
Reproducing these results is a test of the correctness of codes, either written by the user or obtained elsewhere.
The explicit conditions for each of the sets of results are supplied so that meaningful comparisons of your results with the ones listed here are possible.
